Gateway API for External HTTP Traffic
This repository contains the configuration for a Gateway API resource that exposes an external HTTP endpoint for your Kubernetes cluster.
Once the Gateway is deployed, you can create HTTPRoute resources to define routing rules for incoming traffic. For example, you could create an HTTPRoute that routes traffic to a specific service based on the request path or headers.
